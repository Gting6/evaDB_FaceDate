# evaDB_FaceDate

## Introduction

It's a common observation that couples often resemble each other. This phenomenon sparks discussions about our inclination to be drawn to those who share similarities with us. Research studies delve into this intriguing aspect of attraction. Consequently, I **build a dating app that suggests potential matches based on similarities**.

In my last project, I integrated evaDB with AWS Rekognition services, augmenting this database with robust computer vision capabilities. The seamless SQL interface of evaDB coupled with image search capabilities from AWS Rekognition sets the ideal foundation for constructing this dating app.

To achieve this, I explore the REST API of evaDB. I chose React for the frontend framework, Flask for the backend, and leveraged evaDB as the core database to develop the prototype of FaceDateâ€”a dating app centered around identifying similarities.
